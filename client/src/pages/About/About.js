          <p>
            Iâ€™m a passionate B.Tech Computer Science student at St. Mary's Women's Engineering College, 
            currently in my 4th year with an 8.7 GPA. As an Angular Full Stack Intern at Infosys Springboard, 
            I developed an online travel guide web application, gaining hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, 
            JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Node.js, Express.js, and Nodemailer. I enjoy learning new technologies 
            and solving real-world problems through innovative software. I hold an elite NPTEL certification 
            in Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms using Python. I'm eager to contribute to challenging 
            projects that drive growth and innovation.
